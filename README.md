## Conclusions
- 
Majority of borrowers asked for rounded number that is 5000 , 10,000 as observed from the Distribution graph
Majority of the people were funded
In the 129 people whose loan were not approved, majority of the people paid off the loan so it is better to provide them loans and reduce the business loss
Majority of the people have took the 36 months tenure period
Majority of the people have taken loan in the end of the year
Majority of the people have taken loan in 2011 and after every year, the number of loan borrowers have increased
California state has highest number of loan count
People having 10+ year experience are majority of applicants of the loan
Majority of the people who applied for the loan are living on rent or mortgage
The interest rate in charged off were higher than that of fully paid which may infer that higher interest rate could result in higher charge offs
The percentage of defaulters are higher in 60 months term with about 25% charge-off whereas it is just 11% for 36 month term. So, there is a possibility that longer term loans are more risky and prone to higher default
People having less income are more likely to default.
Small business are more likely to charge off compared to other purpose as they are the 28% of people who charged off
By observing the median and 3rd quartile people who have taken higher installment amount are likely to charge off
As the grades gets lower, charge off rate increases proportionately
As the sub-grades gets lower, charge off rate increases proportionately
Higher the dti,more likely the charge off
As number of bankruptcies increases the charge off rate also increases

Lending club should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months tenure, they are prone to loan 
default.
Grades are good metric for detecting defaulters. Lending club should examine more information 
from borrowers before issuing loans to Low grade (G to A).
Lending Club should control their number of loan issues to borrowers who are from CA, FL and 
NY to make profits.
Small business loans are defaulted more. Lending club should stop/reduce issuing the loans to 
them.
Borrowers with mortgage home ownership are taking higher loans and defaulting the approved 
loans. Lending club should stop giving loans to this category when loan amount requested is more 
than 12000.
People with more number of public derogatory records are having more chance of filing a 
bankruptcy. Lending club should make sure there are no public derogatory records for borrower
